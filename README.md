# Is That Even a Word? le

Guess the word in 8 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will 
change to show how close your guess was to the word.

The solution can be any 5-letter word that the New York Times does <strong>not </strong>
include in their word list. Note that the solution is not necessarily obscure:
The NYT rarely use plurals ending in "s" or past tense verbs ending in "ed."
However, you are free to guess any valid 5-letter word.
